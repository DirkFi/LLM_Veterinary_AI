Approach the cat with confidence and handle him gently. If you are calm and go about this matter-of-factly, most cats handle moderate restraint and treatments reasonably well. Many can be coaxed into accepting the procedure and do not need to be restrained. Cooperative cats can be lifted onto a smooth, raised surface, such as a tabletop or a high tier of a cat tree. The cat will be less secure‚Äîbut still not frightened. Speak in a calm, soothing voice until the cat relaxes. Rubbing the ears and scratching the head will calm many cats.

      "üìÑ Full Original Content: TRANSPORTING AN INJURED CAT No matter how docile by basic nature, any cat in pain may scratch or bite. Proper handling will prevent injuries. Furthermore, struggling can cause a weak or injured cat to tire quickly and can induce shock and collapse. If you are able to handle the cat, pick him up as described in Cooperative Cat (page 2), then settle him over your hip so his rear claws project out behind you where they can do no harm. Press the inside of your elbow and forearm against the cat‚Äôs side, holding him firmly against your body. If the cat is frightened or in pain, take precautions to avoid injury. Lift the cat at once from behind by the nape of the neck, support his body under- neath, and lower him into a cat carrier or a cloth bag such as a pillowcase. The material must not be airtight, or the cat will smother. If you have a blanket or towel, throwing this over the cat and then scoop- ing him up often works well. Make sure the cat can breathe. To transport the cat, lower him, towel and all, into a carrier or box. Transport the cat to the veterinary hospital. A cat with a possible back injury should be carried on a piece of stiff card- board or small wooden board or stretcher. Masking tape can be stretched over the cat to hold him on the stretcher or a blanket can be wrapped around the stretcher and cat to hold him securely. ‚Äîo‚Äî\n",

It is important to recognize this and take proper precautions to keep from being bitten. It is therefore wise to always have control of a cat‚Äôs head. There are several effective ways to handle and restrain a cat. Your choice will depend on whether the individual animal is tranquil and cooperative or frightened and aggressive. Remember that cats have five sets of weapons‚Äî one mouth and four feet. They are extremely skilled in using these weapons, and will not hesitate to do so.\n",
