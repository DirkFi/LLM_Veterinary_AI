      "📄 Full Original Content: fh 7 4 • CAT OWNER’S HOME VETERINARY HANDBOOK Frightened cats can be picked up by covering the animal with a towel. After a minute or two, as the cat becomes calmer, slide the rest of the towel under- neath and lift the cat up as a bundle. This method works for aggressive cats as well, although you may want to wear thick leather gloves and use a thick blan- ket. It is a good idea to push a slip leash over the cat’s head. This way, if he strug- gles and jumps out of your arms, at least he cannot completely escape. Aggressive cats can be picked up by slipping a leash or a loop of rope over the cat’s head and one front leg. Then lift the animal by the leash and set him down on a table or into a cat carrier or box. Do not attempt to lift the cat sim- ply with a loop around his neck. This method should be used only as a last resort (when the method above doesn’t work), because it is certain to agitate the cat further. Another option is to use a small squeeze cage or squeeze box. The cat is lured into a special box that can be tightened gently around the body to allow for injections and a minimal physical exam. A fishing net can also be used to contain the cat, but beware of claws reaching through!\n",

Approach the cat with confidence and handle him gently. If you are calm and go about this matter-of-factly, most cats handle moderate restraint and treatments reasonably well. Many can be coaxed into accepting the procedure and do not need to be restrained. Cooperative cats can be lifted onto a smooth, raised surface, such as a tabletop or a high tier of a cat tree. The cat will be less secure—but still not frightened. Speak in a calm, soothing voice until the cat relaxes. Rubbing the ears and scratching the head will calm many cats. Place one hand around the front of the cat’s chest to keep him from moving forward. Use your other hand to administer treatment.\n",

There are several effective ways to handle and restrain a cat. Your choice will depend on whether the individual animal is tranquil and cooperative or frightened and aggressive.

      "📄 Full Original Content: Fh 7 6 • CAT OWNER’S HOME VETERINARY HANDBOOK Uncooperative cats can be handled in several ways, depending on the degree of agitation. If the cat is cooperative enough to permit handling. Some cats respond with quiet to simply having the scruff held and gently tugged back and forth or holding the scruff and gently tapping on the head as a dis- traction. This is more likely to be true for cats under age 1. If this is not the case, hold the scruff and press firmly against the top of the table so that the cat stretches out. These actions will prevent you from being scratched by the cat’s rear claws. When help is available, have your assistant stand behind the cat and place both hands around the cat’s neck or front legs while pressing their arms against the cat’s sides. Wrapping a towel or blanket around the cat has a calm- ing effect and is useful for short procedures such as giving medication. An assistant is required to steady the cat and hold the wraps in place. A coat sleeve makes an excellent restraint. The cat will often scoot into it willingly. Hold the end of the sleeve securely around the cat’s neck. Now you can treat the head or tail. Cat bags are special bags made for restraining cats. You place the cat on the unzipped bag, then quickly zip it around his body up to his neck. Some veteri- narians really like them. However, cat bags are widely disliked by cats, and they struggle about getting into it and may not be calm once inside. An easier solution may be to simply wrap the cat in a towel. There are also muzzles made especially for cats. These have a cloth circle to enclose the muzzle and, usually, a snap lock strap to go behind the ears.\n",
