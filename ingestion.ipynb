      "📄 Full Original Content: th 7 Body type, activity level, coat, individual metabolism, and a host of other factors affect how much food a cats needs. This lithe, active Abyssinian will need more calories per day than a sedentary, heavy-bodied cat. The bottom line on feeding requirements is that each cat is an individual. You need to look at your cat objectively and determine the correct amount of food based on her activity level and metabolic rate, as well as the nutrient density of the food you feed her. Cats vary widely in the amount of food required to maintain normal body weight and should be fed whatever is necessary to maintain the ideal body condition. This means the ribs cannot be seen but are easily felt, and the abdomen is trim but not flabby. Older, sedentary cats require fewer calories than the amounts indicated in the table, while active cats require more. Considerably more food is required for nonmaintenance activities, such as pregnancy and lactation. Select several nutritionally complete cat foods and offer them one at a time to your cat for several days in succession. Note which ones your cat seems to like best. Having found two or three products acceptable to your cat, use them interchangeably to provide variety and appetite appeal. This is also a good idea in case of food recalls so that your cat will eat another food. Cats may be fed free choice, where dry food is available at all times, if the cat is active and maintains good body condition. (Canned products should be fed twice a day, at the same time each day, and left out for just 20 minutes. After that, throw away what hasn’t been eaten in the cat’s dish.) If your cat tends toward obesity, however, food should not be left down free choice. Even dry food can be put out for just 10 or 15 minutes two or three times a day. Here it becomes important to consult page 503 to determine caloric requirements—with a view to keeping the cat healthy and trim. There are advantages to feeding meals.
