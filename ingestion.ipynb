      "Internal parasites are common in cats, often picked up through exposure to mosquitoes and fleas indoors, hunting outdoors, or nursing from an infected mother. Signs of infection include changes in stool appearance (mucus or blood), decreased appetite, weight loss, protruding third eyelid, diarrhea, and anemia. Common parasites include ascarids, tapeworms, and hookworms. Healthy adult cats develop some immunity to parasites, but kittens and young cats are more susceptible due to a lack of resistance.\n",
      "📄 Full Original Content: page_content='GASTROINTESTINAL PARASITES Most cats will suffer from internal parasites at some time in their lives. Kittens can be infected through nursing. Cats who go outside, especially if they hunt, are also prone to picking up parasites. Even cats who live completely indoors may be exposed from a new cat joining the family or by catching a mouse that snuck into the house. Mosquitoes and fleas inside your home can also carry parasites. The ideal parasite lives in its host without causing serious health problems. However, once parasite populations reach a certain size, clinical signs of ill- ness become evident in the animal in which they live. If worms are causing a problem, there is often some change in the appearance of the cat’s stool, which may include the passage of mucus or blood. There is also a decline in the cat’s general health. You may note decreased appetite, loss of weight, sometimes protrusion of the third eyelid, diarrhea, and anemia. Ascarids (roundworms), tapeworms, and hookworms are the most common intestinal parasites in cats. Healthy adult cats develop a certain degree of immunity to parasites, which helps keep any populations down. This varies with the individual parasite, though. For example, some parasites, such as tapeworms, return time after time. It is probable that cats, like dogs, develop a resistance to certain intestinal parasites whose larvae migrate in the animal’s tissues (such as ascarids and hookworms), although this has not been proven in cats. Tapeworms have no migratory phase and thus cause little buildup of immunity. Resistance to ascarids also appears to be age-related. Kittens and young cats show less resistance and, in consequence, may experience a heavy infes- tation. This can lead to marked debility or even death. Cats over 6 months of age are less likely to show significant clinical signs.' metadata={'doc_id': 'e434dba4-5cee-4837-a94e-7224d0fffae1'}\n"
