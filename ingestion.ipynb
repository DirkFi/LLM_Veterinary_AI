      "üìÑ Full Original Content: page_content='NUTRITION Compared to humans, the cat‚Äôs sense of taste is far less refined. We have 9,000 taste buds, while cats have only 473. These special mushroom-shaped papillae are present at the tip and sides of the tongue. A set of cup-shaped papillae are located at the back of the tongue. Cats are responsive to the basic tastes of sour, bitter, and salty. Recent stud- ies have shown that cats cannot taste sweet things at all. As strict carnivores, there really is no need for them to respond to sweet tastes. The rough, prickly feline tongue is covered with tiny hooklike barbs. Cats use their tongues to remove feathers or fur from their prey and to lick meat from the bones. They also use them to groom. A cat‚Äôs tongue mimics a spoon when drinking, enabling her to lap up liquids in quantity, swallowing after every third or fourth lap. Cats make up for their poor sense of taste with a superior sense of smell. In fact, both senses are registered in the same area of the feline brain. That is why heating food to intensify the aroma may tempt a cat who is not eating well. Food straight from the refrigerator doesn‚Äôt appeal to cats, whose wild ancestors ate freshly killed prey while it was still warm.' metadata={'doc_id': 'e330983d-355b-4b67-98bc-ef44e43234d2'}\n",

      "* High carbohydrate content may predispose to diabetes and FLUTD (feline lower urinary tract disease).\n",
      "* Nutritional value decreases over time and should not be used after 6 months of storage.\n",
      "üìÑ Full Original Content: page_content='Dry Cat Food All dry foods contain some sort of carbohydrate product that is used to form the kibbles. Often, it‚Äôs a grain such as wheat, corn, or rice. Grain-free dry foods are also available, but they contain an alternate carbohydrate source, such as potatoes. During processing, dry foods are cooked to 150¬∞F (65.5¬∞C), which breaks down the starch in the cereals, increasing their digestibility. The temperature flash also sterilizes the product and removes most of the moisture. Dry foods are the least expensive. They can also be left out at all times, enabling the cat to eat at will. This is a more natural way for cats to eat, but may contribute to obesity. Dry foods are abrasive and help keep the teeth clean and sharp. However, the shearing forces generated when a cat chews dry kibble may also be impli- cated in feline oral resorptive lesions (see page 243). A disadvantage of dry food is that palatability may be less than other types. However, most cats accept it well. Dry foods often have 20 percent to 50 percent carbohydrates, so they have less animal tissues. The protein content in some dry foods may not be ideal for cats. It‚Äôs important to read the labels carefully. A potential disadvantage of dry food is that the high carbohydrate content has been suggested as a possible predisposing factor in the development of dia- betes. Also, because of its lower moisture content, it may predispose a cat to FLUTD. Due to their desert origins, cats drink little water and may not drink until they are 3 percent to 5 percent dehydrated. Cats who eat only dry food are not taking in nearly the amount of fluid that cats eating canned food are. Some cats may need to be encouraged to drink more if they are fed only dry food. Dry foods tend to lose their nutritional value over time and should not be used after six months of storage.' metadata={'doc_id': 'ebaeac0f-4e4b-4b48-9a7b-6b1a3442cc74'}\n"

However, according to general guidelines, a healthy adult cat typically weighs between 8-12 pounds (3.6-5.4 kg) for males and 6-9 pounds (2.7-4 kg) for females.\n",
