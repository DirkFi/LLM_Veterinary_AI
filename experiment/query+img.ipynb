       "   'original': 'Diets for Health Problems Great progress has been made in developing diets that are helpful in treating and/or controlling health problems in cats. Many of these are available only by prescription or through your veterinarian. These diets are customized to be ideal for certain health problems, such as allergies and food intolerance, kid- ney problems, diabetes, and certain types of urinary stones. Do not start your cat on one of these diets without veterinary supervision, as they may cause problems for a cat with normal health.',\n",

       "   'original': 'FEEDING GERIATRIC CATS Preventing obesity is the single most important thing you can do to prolong the life of an older cat. Geriatric cats are less active and may require up to 30 percent fewer calories than do younger cats. If the cat’s diet is not adjusted accord- ingly, overfeeding will result in weight gain. If you are feeding canned cat food, divide the daily ration into two or three equal parts and feed them at regular intervals throughout the day. Although canned foods need to be stored in the refrigerator once opened, many geriatric cats will eat better if the food is slightly warmed before feeding. Underweight cats may be better off with three or four meals a day.',\n",

      "2. The potential cause of this main issue could be a lack of proper care, inadequate nutrition, or poor quality food, which may lead to malnutrition and health problems in the cat.\n",
      "3. To solve this issue, further assessments such as blood work, urinalysis, and other diagnostic tests may be necessary to determine the underlying causes of the cat's condition. Additionally, a veterinarian should be consulted to develop a customized diet plan that addresses the cat's specific nutritional needs, such as a prescription diet or a tailored feeding regimen. The veterinarian can also rule out any underlying health issues that may be contributing to the cat's malnutrition and provide guidance on how to improve the cat's overall health and well-being.\n"
