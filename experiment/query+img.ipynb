      "\n",
      "* A cat's nutritional needs vary depending on body type, activity level, coat, metabolism, and individual factors.\n",
      "* Each cat is unique, so monitoring food intake and adjusting based on activity level and metabolic rate is crucial.\n",
      "* Cats require more calories for non-maintenance activities, such as pregnancy and lactation.\n",
      "* Consider offering multiple nutritionally complete cat foods to determine your cat's preferences and adjust feeding accordingly.\n",
      "* Feeding free choice can be suitable for active cats, but not recommended for obese cats.\\nSummary: Customized diets are available to treat or control various health issues in cats, such as allergies, food intolerance, kidney problems, diabetes, and certain types of urinary stones. These diets should only be started under the guidance of a veterinarian, as they may cause harm if given to healthy cats.\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mImproving a Domestic Shorthair Cat's Overall Health and Well-being:\n",
